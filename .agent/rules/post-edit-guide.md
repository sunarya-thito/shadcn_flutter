After making edits, make sure to run "flutter analyze" on the file you just edited.
Check if there is any warnings, and implement a fix for it.
Make sure to do some clean up such as dart format, dart fix, and some manual cleanups:
- Unused variables: Make sure the unused variable is actually unused and not just some variable that was actually needed in the implementation plan. If its actually unused, then remove it.
